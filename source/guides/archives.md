All e-signed documents from Jan 1, 2019 onward should be filed in the folder [2019_data_room_CONFIDENTIAL](https://mattermost.app.box.com/folder/64655643423). 

- All files should be renamed `[FINAL_SIGNATURE_DATE]_[ENTITY_NAME]_[AGREEMENT_TYPE]` all in lowercase with underscores for spaces 
- All files should be filed in TRIPLICATE by date, entity and agreement type 

The purpose of this system is to optimize for the following: 

1. Fast look-up - By providing three of the most common ways to find files 
2. Resiliency - Using folders instead of tags allows us to switch file storage systems without losing data.
